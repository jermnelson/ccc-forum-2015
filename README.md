## Now what? A Library Linked-Data How-to for your digital Audio Objects

Digital audio files, either born-digital or digitalized from analog sources, 
is just the first step to providing long-term access and preservation of 
your valuable digital asset. The popular open-source digital repository 
platform Fedora Commons, used extensively by such institutions as Stanford 
and Columbia universities and the Smithsonian, recently released a new 
version that besides providing for the preservation of your audio digital 
object now offers a much more flexible and richer method of describing 
your object for long-term access by implementing a technology called 
linked data. The Library of Congress MARC21 replacement called [BIBFRAME][BF] 
is a linked data vocabulary along with other ontologies like [Schema.org][SCHEMA]. 
This presentation will demonstrate a few projects that use digital audio 
objects using an open-source project called the semantic server, created and 
actively developed by Jeremy Nelson, for a pilot BIBFRAME catalog called 
[bibcat][BC] being developed under contract with the Library and Congress 
and for Colorado College's Music Library Reserves. Finally, you'll receive 
more information about using these technologies for your institution.
