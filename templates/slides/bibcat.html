      <h1>BIBCAT</h1>
       <p class="lead">In the fall of 2014, Aaron Schmidt of Influx Library User Interface Design and I were
         awarded a contract with the Library of Congress for a <b>BIBFRAME Search and Display Systems</b>
         that resulted in <a href="http://bibcat.org">BIBCAT</a> - a BIBFRAME Catalog - a lightweight catalog web application that
         uses the backend BIBFRAME Datastore. Check out the current pilot that is loaded with sample datasets from the 
         Library of Congress (original records were generated from MARC records related to the subjects, "Mark Twain" and "Bible")
         at <a href="http://bibcat.org/">bibcat.org</a>.
